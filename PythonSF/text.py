My name is Py! Today you will enjoy some fun and frivolity at the city's most popular sites!

San Francisco is one of the most popular and peculiar destinations in the country, and as a result, people have some very strange quirks!

SFers are picky about how they communicate, which you will learn soon enough.

In order to speak with many of the locals, you will need to learn 'Parseltongue', a finicky language if there ever were one.

Don't worry, you'll learn as you go, and I can try to help when necessary!

First stop: Fisherman's Wharf for a bite to eat!


""".split("\n")

mervs_mack = """
You and Py arrive at a little 'hole in the pier' called 'MMM', a good sign of tasty treats inside!
Your mouth waters a bit and you take a step in, where you smell fried foods and happiness!

Py says:
Here we are at Merv's Mackerel and More! Merv has some of the most scrumptious seafood in SF, let's see what he's got cooking today!

A gruff man with a burly beard and dirty apron walks up to you and Py and introduces himself as Merv. 
He seats you at a booth, says that your server will be over in a moment, and then scurries off.

Hey ya'll! My name is Richie, one thing I need to say up front is, I only understand Parseltongue, so here are the rules:

In order to communicate with me, you will have to print your answers! This way I will be able to hear you and respond.
To print, you will simply type print and then type what you would like to say.

It will look like this:  
print 'Hello Richie' 
or:
print "Hello Richie" 

Ok! Give it a shot, remember, just type print, and then wrap your repsonse in quotation marks! Capitalization matters!

""".split("\n")

after_print = """
Great, you have mastered the art of printing a string!

When you need to make a statement or ask me a question, you will print a string. You can also print other types...but we'll learn those later!
A string is a list of characters bookended by double or single quotation marks.

Ok now to the good stuff, eats! Today, we have 4 specials on the menu, and 2 drink options.

For Food we have:     Price
1. King Crab Legs:    $13.60
2. Clams Casino:      $12.30
3. Fried Oysters:     $15
4. Merv's Mackerel:   $11

For Drinks we have:   Price
5. Pink Lemonade      $2.50
6. Sweet Tea          $3

Ok, take a look at the menu, and I'll be right back!

Py Says:
MMM, tasty menu! Ok we have $40 for lunch! To make it easier to translate our choices into Parseltongue, each item has a nickname after the arrow:
King Crab Legs    -->    crab      cost    13.60
Clams Casino      -->    clams     cost    12.30
Fried Oysters     -->    oyst      cost    15
Merv's Mackerel   -->    mack      cost    11
Pink Lemonade     -->    pink      cost    2.50
Sweet Tea         -->    sweet     cost    3

Each item has a price, either with or without a decimal place. 

A whole number is called an Integer or int.

A number with a remainder (decimal place) is called a Float.

Now that you understand the difference, answer me this:

Which of the food and drink items on the above menu are Floats?
Print the Floats' nicknames, separated by commas, in the order they appear in the list. 
Don't forget quotations around what you want to print!
""".split("\n")

Ok, now let's do the same thing, but this time you will be printing the items with Integers (whole numbers) for prices!
Same rules apply, don't forget your quotation marks, and the order matters!

Awesome! Now that we have quenched our thirst for knowledge, let's get some grub BAYBEE!

We have the menu items and prices, now we just have to order 2 entrees and 2 drinks - one for each of us!
Make sure to order 4 different items, otherwise we won't be able to order. Blame Merv for poor planning!

Py says:
While we nosh on fish and sweet drinks, let's learn our last restaurant type: Booleans!
Booleans have two values: True and False. For our purposes, we'll be solving if we have enough money to leave Richie an %18 tip: True or False?

First: How much money did we bring? (hint: only enter the integer)
